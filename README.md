# Open-world

## Intro

My concept for the map was three biomes at three different heights. At the first height there
is a beach where you start and where you can enter the sea for a bit. On the second height
there is a green forest area through which water flows. Finally, there is the highest area, it is
based on a rocky area mixed with the idea of the mushroom island from Minecraft.
I also raised the idea of making a final building, the first idea was to make a tribute to a book
saga and model the city of Urithiru, but seeing the lack of time it remained like a giant
glowing cylinder

## Guide the player

The player can be guided by the different paths that exist throughout the map to navigate it.
There is also a launcher, the glowing cylinder, to guide the player to the higher parts. On the
other hand, there are also a few structures to guide the player and let them know that there
are coins nearby. I have also used blocking the path with elevations to guide the player or
blocking the view towards a point of interest so that they go the other way and then see it
from another angle.
Another point to keep in mind is that I have designed the map thinking that as you go up you
feel like you are progressing on your trip.

## Composition

The map primarily has a Dynamic (Asymmetric) layout, but at certain points a Static
(Symmetric) layout is used to make the player face certain locations.
As for the composition, I will divide it into the three areas that the map has.
First zone:
In this area regarding the composition layers:
Foreground: As for what you usually have around you, they are small mounds of stone and
sand.
Center of Interest: The different structures of interest
Background: In the background is the sea and the following area
In the first area, there are several observation points due to the different elevations of the
terrain, but without being able to discover the second area.
Second zone:
In this area regarding the composition layers:
Foreground: There are flowers, bushes, and trees
Center of Interest: The different structures of interest
Background: In the background is the sea, the previous area and the next area.
This area already acts as an observation point for the first one, but it also has its own level
with the different buildings and mountains.
Third zone:
In this area regarding the composition layers:
Foreground: Mushrooms and red trees
Center of Interest: The different structures of interest and rocky passes
Background: In the background is the sea, the previous areas.
This area acts as an observation point for the two previous areas, but it does not have any
for the level itself, since being a small area it is easy to guide yourself.

## Objectives

The coins are typically placed near or at different points of interest on the map. But there are
some that you have to go out of your way to find or solve, a simple platforming.
